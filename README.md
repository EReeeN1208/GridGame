# GridGame
 A basic 'game' where the user can explore through 2-D ASCII maps. This is really just a small project I'm working on as a hobby, don't expect much from it.

# To Do:
Add a border to the display, to prevent blank tiles from blending in with the background

Prevent Range Errors when trying to move past the borders.


# Ideas:

Variations in Tiles

Procedural Map Generation

Map Interaction
